This folder is for application resources used by the WeatherApp UI.

Place your icon images in `src/main/resources/icons/`.
Recommended sizes:
- small: 16x16 (for lists)
- medium: 48x48 (for panels)
- large: 128x128 (for splash or detailed views)

You may also add custom fonts to `src/main/resources/fonts/` and load them via
`Font.createFont(...)` in the UI code.

Examples:
- `icons/server.png`
- `icons/weather_clear.png`
